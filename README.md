# MATH6380P: Mini Project 1

In this repository, we provide our poster and codes for MATH6380P: Mini Project 1.

## Requirement
To install the required libraries to run, please ``pip install -r requirement.txt``.

## Contents
All the codes are provided in jupyter notebook. To reproduce the results shown in the poster, you can run the notebooks for a different purpose:
- scattering.ipynb: Feature extraction by Wavelet Scattering Transform and statistical analysis of extracted features.
- resnet18.ipynb: Feature extraction by ResNet18 (both pre-trained and fine-tuned) and statistical analysis of extracted features.
- image_classification.ipynb: Image classifications using traditional supervised learning methods (SVM, kNN, GBM) based on the features extracted.
- visualization.ipynb: Visualize extracted features using PCA and t-SNE.
